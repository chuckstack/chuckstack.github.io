        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p> This privacy notice explains what we do with personal information.  </p>
        <p> We commit to upholding the key data protection principles and data subject rights described in global and local data protection regulations.  </p>
        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p> Like many websites, the services may use cookies to obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses our site. Cookies are used most commonly to do things like tracking page views, identifying repeat users and utilizing login tokens for a session.  </p>
        <p> The services use session cookies to anonymously track a user’s session on the services to deliver a better experience. You can block or delete these cookies through your browser’s settings.  </p>
        <p> You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our services though your access to some functionality may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.  </p>
        <h4>Data Transfers</h4>
        <p> Use of the services is voluntary and users may choose whether or not they wish to use them. Because we offer our services to people in different countries and use technical infrastructure based in the United States, we may need to transfer your personal information across borders in order to deliver our services.  </p>
        <h4>Information Security</h4>
        <p> We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the privacy and security of the information we maintain about you. The connection between your computer and our servers is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software that encrypts that information. We use a digital certificate and secure pages will be identified by a padlock sign and “https://” in the address bar.  </p>
        <p> However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us cannot be guaranteed.  </p>
