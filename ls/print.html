<p><strong>What makes us special?</strong> <u><i>conversational enterprise computing</i></u> on an open source technology stack... We are tired of ERP's hitting organizations with thousands of barely relevant fields that over complicate processes. We offer a better way for small and medium organizations to manage data, automate processes and build <a href="./terminology.html#superclerk">superclerk</a> talent.</p>
<!-- /copied_from_home_page -->
<p>chuck-stack is a collection of:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="./stack-tools.html">well understood tools</a></li>
<li><a href="./best-practices.html">business best practices</a></li>
<li><a href="./stack-application.html">application framework</a></li>
</ol>
<p>...that puts self-help automation in the hands of the people who actually do the work. With the chuck-stack, everyday clerks use AI and well-formed work instructions to remove complexity and automate tasks. What was tedious becomes scripted. Scripts become menu options. Options connect to form data pipelines.</p>
<p>We transform 20+ person departments of clerks into 2-person teams of <a href="./terminology.html#superclerk">superclerks</a>. We give operational managers the power to guide their teams with just a few words. We ensure those words are considered in every action.</p>
<p>We help organizations focus on what matters most - its people and value proposition to the world.</p>
<!-- keep just in case useful later
**chuck-stack exists to solve a problem:** many (if not most) small to medium organizations do not have the knowledge and resources to automate their processes. This is largely because ERP and most development frameworks are too big, slow, expensive and complicated from almost every perspective (learn, configure, develop, audit, deploy, train, service, scale, enhance, etc...).
-->
<h2 id="purpose"><a class="header" href="#purpose">Purpose</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of the chuck-stack is to help organizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase transactional velocity and efficiency</li>
<li>Identify and deploy AI-enabled, self-service tools that drive innovation from everyone in your organization</li>
<li>Build an internal and external community of support and innovation</li>
</ul>
<p>If we succeed executing our purpose, we will give small and medium sized organizations a competitive advantage against both its peers as well as larger organizations.</p>
<h2 id="solution-summary"><a class="header" href="#solution-summary">Solution Summary</a></h2>
<p>The chuck-stack consists of three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="./stack-tools.html">Collection of Tools</a>: Linux, PostgreSQL, PostgREST, Nushell, AIChat, Zellij, plus more... that all come together to create a full-featured platform. There is no secret or proprietary sauce. Instead, it is pure open source synergy!</li>
<li><a href="./best-practices.html">Best Practices</a>: make the chuck-stack vision possible. These practices include both organizational and technical topics.</li>
<li><a href="./stack-application.html">Application Framework</a>: executing best practices with the above tools and teaching AI to automate the fundamentals of your organization.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="education"><a class="header" href="#education">Education</a></h2>
<p>The stack-academy exists to help your organization achieve success as quickly as possible. It's an online support infrastructure that teaches organizations how to install and use the tools, leverage best practices, and foster <a href="./terminology.html#superclerk">superclerk</a> talent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teach your technical staff to best introduce the tools with your existing infrastructure.</li>
<li>Teach your operations team how to best prepare for AI automation and AI safety.</li>
<li>Teach your users how to start thinking about automation in their role.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chuck-stack-customers"><a class="header" href="#chuck-stack-customers">chuck-stack Customers</a></h2>
<p>Deploying enterprise systems is not easy. Small and mid-sized organizations often need additional help to ensure success. We support two types of organizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrators - organizations with the specialty of enterprise system deployment and support. These groups often have vertical market expertise that assist their customers in rapid change management and technology adoption.</li>
<li>End-users - organizations who will use the chuck-stack in its operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both types of customers are vitally important to ensuring our mutual success. Both customers are welcome and supported in the <a href="./stack-academy.html">stack-academy</a> and in our community.</p>
<h2 id="why-chuck-stack-is-important"><a class="header" href="#why-chuck-stack-is-important">Why chuck-stack is Important</a></h2>
<p>There is not much like the chuck-stack on the market. There is NO private equity or venture capitalist manipulating the market in hopes of extracting customer profits and executing a windfall chuck-stack sale. Instead, the chuck-stack is built on basic principles and fundamentals to make the world a better place for organizations with a purpose for good. The principles are pretty straight forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find good tools</li>
<li>Publish best practices and welcome feedback</li>
<li>Teach anyone who will listen</li>
<li>Invest in people worthy of your time and effort</li>
<li>Strive for continuous improvement</li>
<li>Tell the truth</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe in a cooperative approach to learning, support and innovation. We work off of principles, and we collectively create an open source platform that values simplicity, stability and self-service.</p>

<!-- copied_from_home_page -->
<p>Imagine a world where your operations team writes <a href="./best-practices.html#organization-best-practices">work instructions</a> and both your system and people magically execute those work instructions with near perfection. Image a world where IT no longer builds tools but instead helps people build logic themselves while ensuring everyone is bound by their roles. You do not need to imagine much longer.</p>
<!-- /copied_from_home_page -->
<h2 id="how-is-this-possible"><a class="header" href="#how-is-this-possible">How is This Possible</a></h2>
<p>Modern AI has a magical ability to understand and use our language to offer valuable opinions and execute tasks. More specifically, it understands work instructions (role, task, and tool definitions), and it can help us automate our organizations, increase velocity and improve efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="problem---too-many-window-and-fields"><a class="header" href="#problem---too-many-window-and-fields">Problem - Too Many Window and Fields</a></h2>
<p>There is a big problem with enterprise applications (like ERP) built over the last 20 years. They are too slow in almost every way. The development tooling is too complicated. They bombard the user with hundreds of fields which often go unused. They are incredibly difficult to test. And, they create tension between organization users and leaders.</p>
<h2 id="chatgpt-showed-us-a-better-way"><a class="header" href="#chatgpt-showed-us-a-better-way">ChatGPT Showed Us a Better Way</a></h2>
<p>ChatGPT re-introduced an amazingly simple yet effective user interface that offered one field: the command line. In the command line, you can type whatever you wish. ChatGPT is often smart enough to understand what you want and finds a way to help you - all from one field.</p>
<h2 id="simple-example"><a class="header" href="#simple-example">Simple Example</a></h2>
<p>If you were to type the following into an AI chatbot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>show me the weather in Berlin and London</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The system is smart enough to look for existing tools that can offer real-time weather.</li>
<li>It is smart enough to know that you want to call the get-weather-tool for all the listed cities.</li>
<li>And, it is smart enough to format the output is a human readable way.</li>
</ul>
<p>These same concepts are true for most foundational large language models (LLMs) like Claude and ChatGPT.</p>
<h2 id="better-example"><a class="header" href="#better-example">Better Example</a></h2>
<p>Let's apply this same concept to a customer service representative (CSR). The following exchange naturally follows the above example:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSR: please create a new sales order for Fred Flintstone, and accept all defaults. Products include 5x 1x4x12, 20x 2x6x8, 50lb penny nails.</li>
<li>System: Done. Your order number is 100775. It is currently drafted, and it can ship as early as tomorrow.</li>
<li>System: Would you like to complete the order?</li>
<li>CSR: Yes, and please text Fred confirmation.</li>
<li>System: Done and done.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="get-a-little-crazy"><a class="header" href="#get-a-little-crazy">Get a Little Crazy</a></h2>
<p>The reality is that a CSR that performs this task 50+ times a day will not be this conversational. They will develop codes to eliminate keystrokes. They will use a microphone when possible. The outsider looking in might not even understand the interaction because of all the abbreviated codes. That is OK. What matters is that the CSR and the system 1. share access to the right data, 2. makes his/her job as easy as possible, and 3. prevent mistakes.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning. There is no limit to the number of examples in an organization where someone wants to take a reasonably complicated process like order entry and distill it down to 5 bullets/interactions.</p>
<h2 id="not-that-crazy"><a class="header" href="#not-that-crazy">Not that Crazy</a></h2>
<p>People and systems are getting smarter and more capable. What used to take a team of clerks thousands of hours can now be accomplished by one superclerk in tens of hours. Let me give you this example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>psql -AXqtc -f query-invalid-customer-address.sql | get entries | aichat -r address-fix-role</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above command shows what can happen when you develop superclerks and you give them the right tools to fix 300k+ addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>psql is a tool that will query the database.</li>
<li>-AXqtc are the psql arguments that shape the data so that it can be parsed.</li>
<li>query-invalid-customer-address.sql contains the query to get 300k addresses to validate.</li>
<li>get entries is a nushell command that extracts the entries.</li>
<li>aichat is a command that communicates with ChatGPT or Claude to perform AI work.</li>
<li>-r is the aichat argument that allows the clerk to pass in the pre-existing work instructions that defines a valid address.</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not need to understand the details of the above scenario; however, you DO need to understand that a single person (superclerk) can write the above one-line string to perform the work of hundreds or even thousands or people hours. This is the power of a purposeful organization using the chuck-stack to find and promote superclerks!</p>
<h2 id="all-you-need-are-work-instructions"><a class="header" href="#all-you-need-are-work-instructions">All You Need are Work Instructions</a></h2>
<p>ChatGPT (and LLMs in general) are very good at understanding languages. This ability goes far beyond English and Spanish. SQL (databases) is a language. If you write it down, a LLM can understand what you want. This is true for both English work instructions and code like SQL, python and rust.</p>
<p>This brings us full circle back to the picture of success:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a world where your operations team wrote work instructions and your system and people magically executed those work instructions for you. Image a world where IT no longer builds tools but instead helps your people build it themselves while ensuring everyone is bound by their documented roles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to supercharge your organization by filling it with superclerks, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write down your work instructions.</li>
<li>Mobilize your technology team to install self-help tools like the chuck-stack.</li>
<li>Hire smart people to do smart work.</li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of this page is to answer frequently asked questions (FAQ) about the chuck-stack.</p>
<h2 id="is-chuck-stack-really-the-name-of-the-project"><a class="header" href="#is-chuck-stack-really-the-name-of-the-project">Is chuck-stack really the name of the project?</a></h2>
<p>Yes and no... Naming a project is hard. chuck-stack is a good starting name given that Chuck Boecking has spent the last 25 years immersed in small-to-medium business ERP, data management, and IT. This project started as result of what we believe to be safe, usable, reliable and performant. If the community believes there is a better name to represent this project, then we will change the name accordingly. That will be a good day!</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-project-guiding-principles"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-project-guiding-principles">What are the project guiding principles?</a></h2>
<p>Here are the chuck-stack design and implementation first principles in order. If you cannot accomplish these principles, little else matters.</p>
<ol>
<li>Protect an organization's revenue stream and people! This needs to be leadership's mantra with any system change.</li>
<li>Deliver enjoyable systems that a) put the right data in the hands of the right users, b) make the user's job as easy as possible, and c) help users prevent mistakes!</li>
<li>Deploy infrastructure that is safe, reliable and performant - in that order! If a system is not safe, reliability does not matter. If it is not reliable, performance does not matter.</li>
<li>Write as little code as is possible. Every line of code is a liability that will cost you in the future. It must be documented, tested, reviewed and maintained. If you can use an existing tool that meets the <a href="https://www.chuck-stack.org/stack-faq.html#how-choose">chuck-stack guidelines</a> in place of writing code, do it!</li>
<li>Support self service by giving users the tools to automate tasks within their roles without direct intervention from IT!</li>

<h2 id="what-is-the-current-status-of-chuck-stack"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-current-status-of-chuck-stack">What is the current status of chuck-stack?</a></h2>
<p>The short answer is: We have been deploying the chuck-stack for more that 10 years. Some parts of the stack are in early alpha. Other parts reached production 15 years ago. Here is a more detailed answer:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.idempiere.org/">iDempiere ERP</a> is the oldest member of the stack. We started deploying it on Linux as early as 2001.</li>
<li>We started deploying <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> on Linux in 2011.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> BI has been in production for us for the last 4 years.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nushell.sh/">Nushell</a> has been in production for us for the last 2 years.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a> has been in production for about 6 months. Note that we have used various ETL tools for the last 10 years.</li>
<li>The AI tools like <a href="https://github.com/sigoden/aichat">aichat</a>, are relatively new. Being able to use these tools to change how people interact with data is also new. This style of UI development is in alpha.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-chuck-stack-an-erp"><a class="header" href="#is-chuck-stack-an-erp">Is chuck-stack an ERP?</a></h2>
<p>No, not yet. Here are our thoughts about becoming an ERP:</p>
<ul>
<li>The biggest hurdle to becoming a viable ERP is data entry.</li>
<li>It is common for an order header to have 90+ columns.</li>
<li>Historically, ERP systems burden users with a sea of fields (representing the 90+ columns).</li>
<li>We do NOT believe this is the best approach because a user will only need to modify three or so fields in a newly drafted order. The remaining fields should just default from either the Business Partner settings or recent orders. Said another way, changing many defaults is the exception, not the rule.</li>
<li>Improving the user experience for the above order scenario is currently our biggest challenge.</li>
<li>Another challenge will be to provide a viable accounting system. In the short term, we will use <a href="https://www.idempiere.org/">iDempiere</a>. In the long term, we will use AI and available references to create an accounting system that best supports our stack. Accounting is one of our strongest areas of our ERP practice.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-capability-sandboxing"><a class="header" href="#what-is-capability-sandboxing">What is capability sandboxing?</a></h2>
<p>Capability Sandboxing is the act of defining roles so well that you can consider them to be a contract and enabling the system to ensure role created automation stays within the confines of the contract.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-most-important-pieces-of-the-chuck-stack-application-framework"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-most-important-pieces-of-the-chuck-stack-application-framework">What are the most important pieces of the chuck-stack application framework?</a></h2>
<p>The two most important pieces of the chuck-stack application are workflow and attributes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Workflow is critical to data management. However, workflow is notoriously difficult. The concepts can be difficult to learn. The applications are often difficult to install and maintain, and they are either too complicated or overly simple. It is incredibly difficult to create a workflow architecture that is both generic enough and easy enough for broad adoption. AI will change the workflow landscape. What was previously tedious, is becoming a conversation.</li>
<li>Attributes and attribute sets are critical to data management. Being able to tag anything with an attribute, or a set of attributes is one of the most common actions in data management.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chuck-stack-tools"><a class="header" href="#chuck-stack-tools">chuck-stack Tools</a></h1>
<p>The purpose of this page is to help you understand what tools we choose to include in the chuck-stack and why we chose them. The chuck-stack has been cultivated over the last 25 years. Much effort, testing and production use has gone into this list of tools and its selection criteria.</p>
<h2 id="selection-criteria-summary"><a class="header" href="#selection-criteria-summary">Selection Criteria Summary</a></h2>
<p>When choosing our stack tools, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on commonly used and well understood tools to make AI augmentation easier. The better AI understands a tool, the more AI can do the work for you.</li>
<li>Choose tools that build on one another: Incus =&gt; Linux =&gt; PostgreSQL =&gt; PostgREST =&gt; Nushell =&gt; AIChat =&gt; Zellij...</li>
<li>Select tools that allow unlimited usage and scale massively.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="selection-criteria-details"><a class="header" href="#selection-criteria-details">Selection Criteria Details</a></h2>
<p>Here are the more detailed guidelines for inclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commonly used</strong> - and well understood to make AI augmentation easier.</li>
<li><strong>Open source</strong> - or at least as open as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Start simple</strong> - easy to understand and reason about. Nix pushes this concept a little (or a lot); however, the power and simplicity it creates is worth the extra effort.</li>
<li><strong>Basic functionality</strong> - supports basics like CRUD (create, read, update and delete) with minimal effort.</li>
<li><strong>Kind educator</strong> - needs someone in the community who makes the technology kind to the target audience.</li>
<li><strong>Kind integrator</strong> - needs someone local to you digitally to help you leverage the tool.</li>
<li><strong>Synergy</strong> - supports other tools in the stack. Example: runs on or integrates with PostgreSQL.</li>
<li><strong>Simple architecture</strong> - not overly complicated relative to the tool's purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise scalability</strong> - it needs to scale to support an organization of at least 1,000+ across multiple continents.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise testing and deployment</strong> - it needs to support team development where improvements can be development, tested and accepted in dedicated environments and easily migrated to production using CI/CD concepts or scripts.</li>
<li><strong>Command Line Interface (CLI) centric</strong> - we love cli interfaces because they are accessible from anywhere.</li>
<li><strong>REST centric</strong> - we love scriptable interfaces that can be called from anywhere (not just the cli).</li>
<li><strong>Globally deployed</strong> - supports any organization in an corner of the world on almost any hosting platform.</li>
</ul>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chuck-stack-best-practices"><a class="header" href="#chuck-stack-best-practices">chuck-stack Best Practices</a></h1>
<p>Best practices make the chuck-stack vision possible. This page is broken down into two types of best practices:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="./best-practices.html#organization-best-practices">Organization</a></li>
<li><a href="./best-practices.html#technology-best-practices">Technology</a></li>
</ol>
<p>It is worth noting the chuck-stack.org site was created as an AI-first website, and it is intended be a pinnacle example of how to write for both humans and AI augmentation. Said another way, it should offer a great example of organization and technology best practices.</p>
<h2 id="organization-best-practices"><a class="header" href="#organization-best-practices">Organization Best Practices</a></h2>
<p>The single best thing you can do to accelerate AI adoption is to implement basic quality practices. If you do not have a quality program/book already, the following should be your first version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are committed to exceeding business partner expectations by executing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./best-practices.html#say-what-we-do">Say what we do</a>.</li>
<li>Do what we said we would do.</li>
<li>Prove that we did it.</li>
<li>Focus on continuous improvement.</li>
<li>Welcome feedback!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you said nothing else to summarize your quality program, this would be enough!</p>
<h3 id="quality-program-principles"><a class="header" href="#quality-program-principles">Quality Program Principles</a></h3>
<p>Before we discuss 'Say what we do', let's first introduce some important principles to help you create something you are proud of and to save your <a href="./stack-faq.html#saving-heartbeats">heart beats</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be kind and concise</strong> - Write the absolute minimum number of words possible in your work instructions. Someone will need to maintain every word you write from now to eternity.</li>
<li><strong>Do not repeat yourself</strong> - Say something once, and reference it everywhere else.</li>
<li><strong>AI knows almost everything</strong> - Do not repeat what AI already knows in your work instructions. Your purpose in writing work instructions is to shrink AI's world so that it knows what is important to you and how you want it discussed. This simple principle will reduce your working instructions by more than half if not more!.</li>
<li><strong>AI creates training</strong> - Rely on AI to build your training aids and quizzes. If you write clear work instructions. AI can handle the rest for you.</li>
<li><strong>Words are best</strong> - Words are your best tool to support your organization and AI.</li>
<li><strong>Pictures rot</strong> - they rot faster than words and are harder to maintain. If you can say it, then say it!</li>
<li><strong>Videos rot</strong> - they rot faster than pictures and are harder to maintain. If you can picture it, then picture it!</li>
<li><strong>State your purpose</strong> - when you do not know what to write, state your purpose. The purpose of this page is to... The rest will flow.</li>
<li><strong>No folders</strong> - all documents/files that you create as part of your work instruction should exist in a single folder/directory. Nested directory structures are an overly simple organization technique. Sub folders/directories should be avoided because of the future pain they will cause you. It is absolutely OK to have 10,000+ documents in a single directory.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="say-what-we-do"><a class="header" href="#say-what-we-do">Say what we Do</a></h3>
<p>Work instructions are documents that state who does what and how. There are three work instruction types we need to document - that's it!</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Roles</code> - responsibilities of a person or system in an organization</li>
<li><code>Tasks</code> - actions to be performed by one or more roles</li>
<li><code>Tools</code> - software or mechanical devices used to perform one or more tasks</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Tasks</code> are easiest work instruction type to start with. It describes how a person or system performs an action. The easiest way to describe tasks is with bullets. Just start writing.</p>
<p>Many of the tasks require the use of tools. You will be tempted to include tool instructions in your tasks. Don't do it!  If you have a task that depends on a tool, reference it so that someone can find the dedicated tool instructions.</p>
<p>Here is a best practices example of a task work instruction referring to a tool:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find open orders using the ERP =&gt; Sales Order window =&gt; "Today's Open Order" search option. <u>Learn more...</u></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, we do not show a picture or screenshot. We do not discuss how to find the ERP. We do not discuss how to navigate. We simply describe the exact destination, and we link to the tool work instructions for further reference.</p>
<p><code>Tools</code> are the next easiest work instructions to document. They simply describe how to navigate, execute, print, etc... The biggest challenge with tools instructions is finding the minimum documentation needed to create success. Error on the side of writing less and test your work instructions. You can always write more later.</p>
<p>Be consistent with how you refer to tool objects. Here are some example guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capitalize the name of a window or menu but lowercase the word 'window'. Example: Sales Order window</li>
<li>Use quotes to identify a specific item if there is a potential for confusion. Example: Payment Term window =&gt; "Net 10" record</li>
<li>Use breadcrumbs to represent multiple steps. Example: ERP =&gt; Sales Order window =&gt; Line subtab =&gt; Process toolbar =&gt; Copy Lines process</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Roles</code> are some of the most important work instructions to create. Roles describe the contract a person or system has with the organization. It describes what they should or should not do.</p>
<p>In the <a href="./picture-success.html">Picture of Success</a>, we describe how the role work instructions ensure a <a href="./terminology.html#superclerk">superclerk</a> does not create anything that violates the role contract. Said another way, properly defined roles give superclerks the freedom to innovate while remaining in the guardrails of their role.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-write"><a class="header" href="#where-to-write">Where to Write</a></h3>
<p>Before we continue with 'Do what we said we would do', Let's discuss best practices in creating and saving and using your work.</p>
<p>You will be tempted to use Microsoft Word or Google Docs to capture your words. Don't do it! If you do, your words will trapped in that format/container. You will be limited as to how you can use your words with AI or any other tool.</p>
<p>Instead, we strongly recommend you use a tool named <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> as your writing environment. It offers the same joyful writing tools; however, it saves your words in a plain text format called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a>. Markdown is quite possibly the most simple yet powerful tool you have in working with people and AI.</p>
<h2 id="technology-best-practices"><a class="header" href="#technology-best-practices">Technology Best Practices</a></h2>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chuck-stack-application-framework"><a class="header" href="#chuck-stack-application-framework">chuck-stack Application Framework</a></h1>
<p>chuck-stack uses the above tools to create an application framework for data and process management. Here are the framework goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize application framework code and complexity by using off-the-shelf tools that are easily understood by people and AI..</li>
<li>Minimize the effort to create new business logic. Ideally, a single command will create the template for you. AI will draft the code for you.</li>
<li>Maximize who in an organization can automate business logic by supporting role-based contracts where role boundaries are well defined and AI can help ensure proper <a href="./stack-faq.html#what-is-capability-sandboxing">capability sandboxing</a> and data integrity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data management goes beyond simple CRUD (create, read, update and delete) database operations. The system needs to make the right data available to the right person at the right time to make their jobs easier. There are two key process features that make this vision a reality: 1) workflow and 2) attribute tagging. Here are the details:</p>
<h2 id="workflow"><a class="header" href="#workflow">Workflow</a></h2>
<p>Workflow is critical to data and process management. However, workflow is notoriously difficult. The concepts can be difficult to learn. The applications are often difficult to install and maintain, and they are either too complicated or overly simple. It is incredibly difficult to create a workflow architecture that is both generic enough and easy enough for broad adoption. AI will change the workflow landscape. What was previously tedious, is becoming a conversation.</p>
<!-- TODO: consider calling this User Facing Workflows to differentiate from developer workflows like events and functions. Or, consider labeling the below bullets with user/developer/system. -->
<p>Here are the important types of workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Journal workflow: everyone in an organization should be able to record the events in an organization. More...</li>
<li>Discussion workflow: everyone in an organization should be able to collaborate with others in an organization. More...</li>
<li>To-do workflow: everyone in an organization should be able to manage a simple list of tasks. More...</li>
<li>Checklist workflow: roles in an organization often have periodic prescribed tasks. Checklists are a predefined and templated to-do tasks. More...</li>
<li>Queue workflow: as people manipulate data, some records will reach a state of importance. Queues are defined views into data that match a specific pattern automatically. When the pattern is found, present the user or role with the matching records.  More...</li>
<li>Notice workflow: events happen, and sometimes users and systems need to be notified. The notification workflow provides information based on the events that occur in an organization.  More...</li>
<li>Ad-hoc request workflow: users and systems often know what needs to happen and who needs to perform the action based on the events that occur in an organization. This is often referred to as institutional knowledge of action. Ad-hoc request workflows allow users or services to request action from a particular user, role or service.  More...</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="postgresql-conventions"><a class="header" href="#postgresql-conventions">PostgreSQL Conventions</a></h1>
<p>The purpose of this page is to describe the concepts and methodologies for creating PostgreSQL designs. Consistent use of conventions create clarity. Here are the values that drive our conventions:</p>
<!-- TODO: these bullets need improvement -->
<ul>
<li>Consistency for clarity</li>
<li>Purpose driven</li>
<li>Reduce development time</li>
<li>Reduce development environment complexity</li>
<li>Reduce learning time</li>
<li>Reduce complexity</li>
<li>Maximize use of conventions</li>
<li>Minimize the number of expertise needed to articulate a design</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="schema"><a class="header" href="#schema">Schema</a></h2>
<p>We use multiple PostgreSQL schemas to create a expose our application logic to the rest of the system.</p>
<h3 id="private-schema"><a class="header" href="#private-schema">Private Schema</a></h3>
<p>We start with a private schema where we define our data model. It is labelled <code>private</code> as a convention because no outside system should interact with this internal schema directly. Said another way, the private schema is used to insulate internal details from the outside world.</p>
<h3 id="public-schemas"><a class="header" href="#public-schemas">Public Schemas</a></h3>
<p>We create at least one public schema. The purpose of the public schemas are to expose a semantically controlled interface. More on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning">semantic versioning</a>. It is possible to maintain multiple public schemas simultaneously in situations where you need two or more major versions versions available at the same time.</p>
<p>If you support a single exposed schema, you can name the publicly available schema something like <code>public</code> or <code>api</code>. If you plan to support multiple schemas simultaneously, you can include the major version number in the schema name like <code>public_v1</code> or <code>public_v2</code>. It is not common to support multiple versions at the same time; however, it does happen.</p>
<p>The separation between private and public schemas allows you to change the private data and logic representations while publicly maintaining semantic version control.</p>
<p>The artifacts in a public schema will most commonly begin as simple pass-through views and functions. Minor and patch releases will most likely introduce more complexity the public schema. Major releases might give you an opportunity to simply the public schema since you can introduce breaking changes to the public api.</p>
<h2 id="table-conventions"><a class="header" href="#table-conventions">Table Conventions</a></h2>
<p>This section discuss how we create tables in the private schema.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tables use a uuid column as the primary key. The purpose of this decision is to make creating very large (and often replicated) systems easier to manage. Doing so also allows for clients to define their own uuid values and removes a potential centralized process.</li>
<li>All tables have a single primary key (even if it is a link table). The purpose of this decision is to enable the concept of table_name + record_uu unique record identification. Said another way, if you know the table_name and the record_uu of any given record, you can always find the details associated with that record. This convention also allows us to create many features that are shared across all records in all tables. These features include centralized logs, attachments, and attributes.</li>
<li>All core chuck-stack tables will begin with <code>stack_</code>. Example: <code>stack_business_partner</code>.</li>
<li>Your organization should chose a table prefix that resembles your organization's name if you wish to add new tables or new columns. Example: the Good-Care Medical organization could have a prefix of <code>gcm_</code>.</li>
<li>Link tables should have a table name suffix of <code>_link</code>. <!-- TODO: add link table to definitions --></li>
<li>Tables should have comments that describe the purpose of the table. Because AI is so proficient at understanding SQL DDL, we can define both how the table operates and why it exists in the same location. Because SQL is self describing, we can query table comments to obtain help documentation is not extra effort.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="column-conventions"><a class="header" href="#column-conventions">Column Conventions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Primary uuid key (<code>_uu</code> suffix) - All tables have a single primary key per the above discussion.</li>
<li>Foreign keys end with a <code>_uu</code> suffix. Example <code>stack_some_other_table_uu</code>. There are times when this convention is not possible due to multiple references to the same table. What a duplicate is needed, add an adjective before the <code>_uu</code> suffix. Examples: <code>stack_business_partner_ship_to_uu</code> and <code>stack_business_partner_bill_to_uu</code>.</li>
<li>When naming columns the noun comes first and the adjective comes next. Example: stack_wf_state_next_uu where state is the noun and next is the adjective. The benefit of this approach is that like columns (and the resulting methods/calls) appear next to each other alphabetically. <!-- TODO: create a list of abbreviations like wf, asi, etc... --></li>
<li>Use columns of type text (instead of varchar with unspecified length). Only choose a varchar with a specific length when there is a compelling reason to do so. Even then try not to...</li>
<li>Boolean values must have a default value defined at the table level.</li>
<li>Consider using the column's description/comment to hold column_label and column_description
<ul>
<li>comment on column wf_process.name is '{"column_label": "Name", "column_description": "Name describing the record"}';</li>
<li>select pg_catalog.col_description(c.oid, col.ordinal_position::int)::json-&gt;&gt;'column_label' ...</li>
<li>see sql/readme.md for more details</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="table-standard-column"><a class="header" href="#table-standard-column">Table Standard Column</a></h2>
<p>This sections lists the mandatory and optional columns found in chuck-stack tables. Notice that coding and naming by convention plays a role in primary key name and foreign key relationships. As you will see below, you know the primary key column name as a function of the table name. You know the foreign key table name as a function of the foreign key column name.</p>
<h3 id="mandatory-columns"><a class="header" href="#mandatory-columns">Mandatory Columns</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>primary key - The primary key column bears the name of the table with a <code>_uu</code> suffix. Example: <code>stack_some_table_uu</code></li>
<li><code>stack_tenant_uu</code> - foreign key reference to the tenant that owns the record <!-- TODO: define tenant and add link here --></li>
<li><code>stack_org_uu</code> - financial set of books that owns the record <!-- TODO: define org and add link here --></li>
<li><code>created</code> - timestamp indicating when the record was created.</li>
<li><code>created_by_uu</code> - uuid foreign key reference to the database user/role that created the record.</li>
<li><code>updated</code> - timestamp indicating when the record was last updated.</li>
<li><code>updated_by_uu</code> - uuid foreign key reference to the database user/role that last updated the record.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="optional-columns"><a class="header" href="#optional-columns">Optional Columns</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>is_active</code> - boolean that indicates if a record can be modified. is_active also acts as a soft-delete. If a record has an is_active=false, the record should be be returned as an option for selection in future lists and drop down fields. This column must be present to update it after the initial save; therefore, it appears in most tables.</li>
<li><code>name</code> - text column representing the name of the record.</li>
<li><code>description</code> - text column representing the description of the record.</li>
<li><code>search_key</code> - user defined text column. The purpose of this column is to allow users to create keys that are more easily remembered by humans. It is up to the implementor to determine if the search_key should be unique for any given table. If it should be unique, the implementor determines the unique criteria. search_key columns are most appropriate for tables that maintain a primary concept but the record is not considered transactional. Examples of non-transactional records include users, business partners, and products.</li>
<li><code>value</code> - text column that is often used along with a <code>search_key</code> in a key-value pair.</li>
<li><code>document_no</code> - user defined text column. The purpose of this column is to allow the system to auto-populate auto-incrementing document numbers. It is up to the implementor to determine if the document_no should be unique. If it should be unique, the implementor determines the unique criteria. The document_no column is most appropriate for tables that represent transactional data. Examples of a transaction records include invoices, orders, and payments. Tables that have a search_key column will not have a document_no column. The opposite is also true. <!-- TODO: define and link implementor --></li>
<li><code>is_default</code> - boolean that indicates if a record should represent a default option. Typically, only one records can have is_default=true; however, there are circumstances where multiple records in the same table can have is_default=true based on unique record attributes. Implementors chose the unique criteria for any given table with a is_default column.</li>
<li><code>is_processed</code> - boolean that indicates of a record has reached its final state. Said another way, if a record's is_processed=true, then no part of the record should updated or deleted. TODO: we need a way to prevent children of processed records to also be assumed to be processed unless the record has its own is_processed column.</li>
<li><code>is_template</code> boolean that indicates if a record exists for the purpose of cloning to create new records.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="function-conventions"><a class="header" href="#function-conventions">Function Conventions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>concept of function =&gt; create_from vs create_into -- attempt to support both when possible <!-- TODO: better define these terms --></li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="terminology"><a class="header" href="#terminology">Terminology</a></h1>
<p>The purpose of this page is to define terminology used in the chuck-stack.org.</p>
<h2 id="entity"><a class="header" href="#entity">Entity</a></h2>
<p>An entity is often a legal or taxation group. A single <a href="./terminology.html#tenant">tenant</a> can have many entities. An entity can belong to only one tenant.</p>
<h2 id="superclerk"><a class="header" href="#superclerk">SuperClerk</a></h2>
<p>A superclerk is someone performing a role who desires to better automate and perfect their role thus propeling the whole team to a new level performance. A superclerk seeks out the tools and the opportunity to do more. A superclerk can be anyone with a job to do. They can be an AP/AR Clerk, Sales Representative, Machinist, Controller, Manager, etc...</p>
<p>The best way to describe a superclerk is by example. Imagine a team of AP and AR clerks. The team spends the majority of the day transcribing data. A superclerk emerges thinking there must be a better way. The superclerk does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ties AI to their email to classify which emails contain new invoices.</li>
<li>Automates sending the invoice to Google's AI document service for data extraction.</li>
<li>Automates mapping the extracted details into a format for invoice upload in the ERP.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that most IT departments could do the same; however, it is also important to note that most IT departments are severely understaffed and behind on existing projects. Identifying superclerks and giving them the tools to automate their roles changes the game and can create an order of magnitude of improvement in both velocity and efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="tenant"><a class="header" href="#tenant">Tenant</a></h2>
<p>A tenant is a group of one or more <a href="./terminology.html#entity">entities</a>. There are times when a single organization manages completely disparate entities. When these entities do not share any aspect of their businesses, the organization will create the different entities in separate tenants.</p>
<p>The chuck-stack is multi-tenant software without being multi-tenant SaaS. A single instance of the chuck-stack can support multiple tenants; however, there is no reason for us to try and create a single, monolithic service trying to cater all organizations in the world. Monolithic SaaS service carry inherent risks that make them susceptible to data breaches and cross-contamination.</p>
<p>Our goal is to use well tested and commonly understood networking services to create isolated tenants of the chuck-stack.</p>

<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<!-- TODO: link to goals -->
<p>It is important to understand that the chuck-stack is not a typical project. The goals of the project are to support small and medium sized businesses by bringing together existing tools to create a platform. As such, most of the advancements of this project relate more to convention, configuration and deployment rather than coding.</p>

<p>The purpose of this page is to give you the back story behind how chuck-stack.org came to exist.</p>
<h2 id="people"><a class="header" href="#people">People</a></h2>
<p>chuck-stack.org was created by Chuck Boecking.</p>
<h2 id="founding-beliefs"><a class="header" href="#founding-beliefs">Founding Beliefs</a></h2>
<p>The chuck-stack project was created based on Chuck's beliefs that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Conversation computing is better than presenting users with a sea of window, tabs and field.</li>
<li>The terminal is the fastest, most robust, economical, stable and secure medium to manage data and processes.</li>
<li>AI will fundamentally change how users will interact with software and the terminal will help lead the way.</li>
<li>Humans will fight to be relevant, and a new breed of superclerks will emerge to drive automation and efficiency in roles.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="before-chuck-stack"><a class="header" href="#before-chuck-stack">Before chuck-stack</a></h2>
<p>Chuck has a MS degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&amp;M University.</p>
<p>Chuck worked as an engineer at National Instruments as it grew from just over $200M to $400M in annual revenue.</p>
<p>Chuck worked as the Director of It and HR at Velocity Electronics as it grew from $500K to $40M in annual revenue. The systems that Chuck installed eventually supported over $800M in annual global revenue.</p>
<p>Chuck spent 23 years supporting the iDempiere open source ERP code base and project.</p>
<h2 id="idempiere-backstory"><a class="header" href="#idempiere-backstory">iDempiere Backstory</a></h2>
<p>iDempiere started life as Compiere (also an open source ERP project). ADempiere was created as a fork from Compiere. iDempiere was created as a fork from ADempiere.</p>
<p>The iDempiere codebase played a significant part of Chuck's professional career. It was the foundation for Velocity's ERP system.</p>
<h2 id="erp-academy"><a class="header" href="#erp-academy">ERP Academy</a></h2>
<p>iDempiere was at the heart of Chuck's ERP Academy for 11 years where Chuck created over 800 videos on the topic of open source ERP and teaching students from over 60 countries.</p>
<p>During this time, Chuck lead 7 medium-sized iDempiere deployments and assisted in over 30 more deployments. Just as important as the deployments are the students that did not deploy iDempiere. The academy was based on guiding users to a true and natural fit. If iDempiere was not the best tool, our mission was to determine that opinion as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>This deep appreciation for someone's time and efforts was a cornerstone of the academy's success.</p>

<h2 id="conduct"><a class="header" href="#conduct">Conduct</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.</li>
<li>Please avoid using overtly sexual aliases or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.</li>
<li>Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.</li>
<li>Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.</li>
<li>Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.</li>
<li>We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the <a href="https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md">Citizen Code of Conduct</a>; if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition.</li>
<li>In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.</li>
<li>Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the chuck-stack moderation team immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.</li>
<li>Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="moderation"><a class="header" href="#moderation">Moderation</a></h2>
<p>These are the policies for upholding our community’s standards of conduct. If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the chuck-stack moderation team.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remarks that violate the chuck-stack standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)</li>
<li>Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.</li>
<li>Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.</li>
<li>If the warning is unheeded, the user will be "kicked," i.e., kicked out of the communication channel to cool off.</li>
<li>If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.</li>
<li>Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.</li>
<li>If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, in private. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.</li>
<li>Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the chuck-stack community, we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don’t just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they’re off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.</p>
<p>And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could’ve communicated better — remember that it’s your responsibility to make your fellow stackers comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.</p>
<p>The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official chuck-stack venues; including communication channels, repositories, and all forums.</p>

<p>This article describes why markdown has become a better tool for documentation than both Microsoft Word and Google Docs. We believe that the use of markdown and the benefits you gain from it represent a point of inflection and a significant change in how documentation and training should be maintained and published.</p>

<p>If you are working with the chuck-stack, all work instructions, content, documentation, instructions, tutorials, etc... should be created in markdown format.</p>
<p>Here are the reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documents can be easily added to a repository (where the documentation is most relevant) and changes can be tracked and reviewed right next to the code/configuration.</li>
<li>The pull request review system is far superior to anything in word/gdoc for creating, reviewing, and publishing works.</li>
<li>Markdown editors like vscode, <a href="https://obsidian.md">obsidian</a>, and almost any modern text editor are as good as word/gdocs for transferring knowledge via formatted text.</li>
<li>We use aichat constantly. We can pass in markdown with no additional effort into any LLM of choice:
<ul>
<li>example: aichat -f somedoc.md -- please create a 3-question quiz on this material to check for general understanding</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Markdown docs can easily be turned into private and public project websites using tools like <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/">mdbook</a> with virtually no effort and almost no tooling. The resulting mdbook website augments the git pull request for edits from the whole team by providing a quick edit link on every page.</li>
</ul>
