<!-- copied_from_home_page -->
<p>chuck-stack is both a collection of tools and an application framework that help small to medium organizations manage data and processes.</p>
<p>chuck-stack exists to solve a problem: many (if not most) small to medium organizations do not have the knowledge and resources to automate their processes. This is largely because ERP and most development frameworks are too big, slow, expensive and complicated from almost every perspective (learn, configure, develop, audit, deploy, train, service, scale, enhance, etc...).</p>
<p>chuck-stack provides a better way to manage the processes and data in your organization. We deliver a simplified, ai-focused application created from a collection of off-the-shelf tools that help organizations focus on what matters most - its people and value proposition to the world.</p>
<!-- /copied_from_home_page -->
<p>The purpose of the chuck-stack is to help organizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase transactional velocity and efficiency</li>
<li>Identify and deploy AI-enabled, self-service tools that drive innovation from everyone in your organization</li>
<li>Build an internal and external community of support and innovation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-chuck-stack-is-important"><a class="header" href="#why-chuck-stack-is-important">Why chuck-stack is Important</a></h2>
<p>We believe in a cooperative approach to learning, support and innovation. As a group, we establish the principles and collectively create an open source platform that values simplicity, stability and self-service.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="stack-faq"><a class="header" href="#stack-faq">Stack FAQ</a></h1>
<p>The purpose of this page is to answer frequently asked questions (FAQ) about the chuck-stack.</p>
<h2 id="is-chuck-stack-really-the-name-of-the-project"><a class="header" href="#is-chuck-stack-really-the-name-of-the-project">Is chuck-stack really the name of the project?</a></h2>
<p>Yes and no... Naming a project is hard. chuck-stack is a good starting name given that Chuck Boecking has spent the last 25 years immersed in small-to-medium business ERP, data management, and IT. This project started as result of what we believe to be safe, usable, reliable and performant. If the community believes there is a better name to represent this project, then we will change the name accordingly. That will be a good day!</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-choose-stack-components"><a class="header" href="#how-do-we-choose-stack-components">How do we choose stack components?</a></h2>
<p>The chuck-stack has been cultivated over the last 25 years. Here are the guidelines for inclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commonly used - and well understood to make AI augmentation easier.</li>
<li>Open source - or at least as open as possible.</li>
<li>Start simple - easy to understand and reason about. Nix pushes this concept a little (or a lot); however, the power and simplicity it creates is worth the extra effort.</li>
<li>Basic functionality - supports basics like CRUD (create, read, update and delete) with minimal effort.</li>
<li>Kind educator - needs someone in the community who makes the technology kind to the target audience.</li>
<li>Kind integrator - needs someone local to you digitally to help you leverage the tool.</li>
<li>Synergy - supports other tools in the stack. Example: runs on or integrates with PostgreSQL.</li>
<li>Simple architecture - not overly complicated relative to the tool's purpose.</li>
<li>Enterprise scalability - it needs to scale to support an organization of at least 1,000+ across multiple continents.</li>
<li>Enterprise testing and deployment - it needs to support team development where improvements can be development, tested and accepted in dedicated environments and easily migrated to production using CI/CD concepts or scripts.</li>
<li>Command Line Interface (CLI) centric - we love cli interfaces because they are accessible from anywhere.</li>
<li>REST centric - we love scriptable interfaces that can be called from anywhere (not just the cli).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-are-the-project-guiding-principles"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-project-guiding-principles">What are the project guiding principles?</a></h2>
<p>Here are the chuck-stack design and implementation first principles in order. If you cannot accomplish these principles, little else matters.</p>
<ol>
<li>Protect an organization's revenue stream and people! This needs to be the CEO mantra with any system change.</li>
<li>Deliver enjoyable systems that a) put the right data in the hands of the right users, b) make the user's job as easy as possible, and c) help users prevent mistakes!</li>
<li>Deploy infrastructure that is safe, reliable and performant - in that order! If a system is not safe, reliability does not matter. If it is not reliable, performance does not matter.</li>
<li>Write as little code as is possible. Every line of code is a liability that will cost you in the future. It must be documented, tested, reviewed and maintained. If you can use an existing tool that meets the <a href="https://www.chuck-stack.org/stack-faq.html#how-choose">chuck-stack guidelines</a> in place of writing code, do it!</li>
<li>Support self service by giving users the tools to automate tasks within their roles without direct intervention from IT!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-is-the-current-status-of-chuck-stack"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-current-status-of-chuck-stack">What is the current status of chuck-stack?</a></h2>
<p>The short answer is: We have been deploying the chuck-stack for more that 10 years. Some parts of the start are in early alpha. Other parts reached production 15 years ago. Here is a more detailed answer:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.idempiere.org/">iDempiere ERP</a> is the oldest member of the stack. We started deploying it on Linux as early as 2001.</li>
<li>We started deploying <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> on Linux in 2011.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> BI has been in production for us for the last 4 years.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nushell.sh/">Nushell</a> has been in production for us for the last 2 years.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a> has been in production for about 6 months. Note that we have used various ETL tools for the last 10 years.</li>
<li>The AI tools like <a href="https://github.com/sigoden/aichat">aichat</a>, are relatively new. Being able to use these tools to change how people interact with data is also new. This style of UI development is in alpha.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-chuck-stack-an-erp"><a class="header" href="#is-chuck-stack-an-erp">Is chuck-stack an ERP?</a></h2>
<p>No, not yet. Here are our thoughts about becoming an ERP:</p>
<ul>
<li>The biggest hurdle to becoming a viable ERP is data entry.</li>
<li>It is common for an order header to have 90+ columns.</li>
<li>Historically, ERP systems burden users with a sea of fields (representing the 90+ columns).</li>
<li>We do NOT believe this is the best approach because a user will only need to modify three or so fields in a newly drafted order. The remaining fields should just default from either the Business Partner settings or recent orders. Said another way, changing many defaults is the exception, not the rule.</li>
<li>Improving the user experience for the above order scenario is currently our biggest challenge.</li>
<li>Another challenge will be to provide a viable accounting system. In the short term, we will use <a href="https://www.idempiere.org/">iDempiere</a>. In the long term, we will use AI and available references to create an accounting system that best supports our stack. Accounting is one of our strongest areas of our ERP practice.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-capability-sandboxing"><a class="header" href="#what-is-capability-sandboxing">What is capability sandboxing?</a></h2>
<p>Capability Sandboxing is the act of defining roles so well that you can consider them a contract and enabling the system to ensure role created automation stays within the confines of the contract.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-most-important-pieces-of-the-chuck-stack"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-most-important-pieces-of-the-chuck-stack">What are the most important pieces of the chuck-stack?</a></h2>
<p>The two most important pieces of the chuck-stack application are workflow and attributes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Workflow is critical to data management. However, workflow is notoriously difficult. The concepts can be difficult to learn. The applications are often difficult to install and maintain, and they are either too complicated or overly simple. It is incredibly difficult to create a workflow architecture that is both generic enough and easy enough for broad adoption. AI will change the workflow landscape. What was previously tedious, is becoming a conversation.</li>
<li>Attributes and attribute sets are critical to data management. Being able to tag anything with an attribute, or a set of attributes is one of the most common actions in data management.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chuck-stack-tools"><a class="header" href="#chuck-stack-tools">chuck-stack Tools</a></h1>
<p>The purpose of this page is to help you understand what tools we choose to include in the chuck-stack and why we chose them. The chuck-stack has been cultivated over the last 25 years. Much effort, testing and production use has gone into this list of tools and its selection criteria.</p>
<h2 id="selection-criteria-summary"><a class="header" href="#selection-criteria-summary">Selection Criteria Summary</a></h2>
<p>When choosing our stack tools, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on commonly used and well understood tools to make AI augmentation easier. The better AI understands a tool, the more AI can do the work for you.</li>
<li>Choose tools that build on one another: PostgreSQL =&gt; PostgREST =&gt; Nushell =&gt; AIChat =&gt; Zellij...</li>
<li>Select tools that allow unlimited usage and scale massively.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="selection-criteria-details"><a class="header" href="#selection-criteria-details">Selection Criteria Details</a></h2>
<p>Here are the more detailed guidelines for inclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commonly used - and well understood to make AI augmentation easier.</li>
<li>Open source - or at least as open as possible.</li>
<li>Start simple - easy to understand and reason about. Nix pushes this concept a little (or a lot); however, the power and simplicity it creates is worth the extra effort.</li>
<li>Basic functionality - supports basics like CRUD (create, read, update and delete) with minimal effort.</li>
<li>Kind educator - needs someone in the community who makes the technology kind to the target audience.</li>
<li>Kind integrator - needs someone local to you digitally to help you leverage the tool.</li>
<li>Synergy - supports other tools in the stack. Example: runs on or integrates with PostgreSQL.</li>
<li>Simple architecture - not overly complicated relative to the tool's purpose.</li>
<li>Enterprise scalability - it needs to scale to support an organization of at least 1,000+ across multiple continents.</li>
<li>Enterprise testing and deployment - it needs to support team development where improvements can be development, tested and accepted in dedicated environments and easily migrated to production using CI/CD concepts or scripts.</li>
<li>Command Line Interface (CLI) centric - we love cli interfaces because they are accessible from anywhere.</li>
<li>REST centric - we love scriptable interfaces that can be called from anywhere (not just the cli).</li>
</ul>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="postgresql-conventions"><a class="header" href="#postgresql-conventions">PostgreSQL Conventions</a></h1>
<p>The purpose of this page is to describe the concepts and methodologies for creating PostgreSQL designs.</p>
<h2 id="table-and-column-conventions"><a class="header" href="#table-and-column-conventions">Table and column conventions:</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Tables use uuid as primary keys. The purpose of this decision is to make creating very large (and often replicated) systems easier to manage. Doing so also allows for clients to define their own uuid values and removing a potential centralized process.</li>
<li>All tables have a single primary key (even if it is a link table). The purpose of this decision is to enable the concept of table_name + record_uu unique record identification. Said another way, if you know the table_name and the record_uu of any given record, you can always find the details associated with that record. This convention also allows for maintaining centralized logs, attachments, and attributes.</li>
<li>The search_key column is a user defined alphanumeric. The purpose of this column is to allow users to create keys that are more easily remembered by humans. It is up to the implementor to determine if the search_key should be unique for any given table. If it should be unique, the implementor determines the unique criteria. search_key columns are most appropriate for tables that maintain a primary concept but the record is not considered transactional. Examples of non-transactional records include users, business partners, and products.</li>
<li>Value is a text column that is often used with a search_key in a key-value pair.</li>
<li>Document_no is a user defined alphanumeric. The purpose of this column is to allow the system to auto-populate auto-incrementing document numbers. It is up to the implementor to determine if the document_no should be unique. If it should be unique, the implementor determines the unique criteria. The document_no column is most appropriate for tables that represent transactional data. Examples of a transaction records include invoices, orders, and payments. Tables that have a search_key column will not have a document_no column. The opposite is also true.</li>
<li>The created column is a timestamp indicating when the record was created.</li>
<li>The created_by_uu column is a uuid pointing to the database user/role that created the record.</li>
<li>The updated column is a timestamp indicating when the record was last updated.</li>
<li>The updated_by_uu column is a uuid pointing to the database user/role that last updated the record.</li>
<li>The is_active column is a boolean that indicates if a record can be modified. is_active also acts as a soft-delete. If a record has an is_active=false, the record should be be returned as an option for selection in future lists and drop down fields.</li>
<li>The is_default column is a boolean that indicates if a record should represent a default option. Typically, only one records can have is_default=true; however, there are circumstances where multiple records in the same table can have is_default=true based on unique record attributes. Implementors chose the unique criteria for any given table with a is_default column.</li>
<li>The is_processed column is a boolean that indicates of a record has reached its final state. Said another way, if a record's is_processed=true, then no part of the record should updated or deleted. TODO: we need a way to prevent children of processed records to also be assumed to be processed unless the record has its own is_processed column.</li>
<li>The is_template column is a boolean that indicates if a record exists for the purpose of cloning records.</li>
<li>when naming columns the noun comes first and the adjective comes next. Example: stack_wf_state_next_uu where state is the noun and next is the adjective. The benefit of this approach is that like columns (and the resulting methods/calls) appear next to each other alphabetically. TODO: needs more example like stack_business_partner_ship_to_uu.</li>
<li>concept of function =&gt; create_from vs create_into -- attempt to support both when possible</li>
<li>use text (over varchar with unspecified length)</li>
<li>link tables always have a single primary uuid key. TODO: this is a dup</li>
<li>link table have the suffix _lnk</li>
<li>consider using the column's description/comment to hold column_label and column_description</li>
<li>comment on column wf_process.name is '{"column_label": "Name", "column_description": "Name describing the record"}';</li>
<li>select pg_catalog.col_description(c.oid, col.ordinal_position::int)::json-&gt;&gt;'column_label' ...</li>
<li>see sql/readme.md for more details</li>

<p>This document explains one of the ways we will create a welcoming global community. Welcome to the team; please make others feel welcome as well!</p>
<h2 id="email"><a class="header" href="#email">EMail</a></h2>
<p>contact@chuboe.com</p>
<h2 id="conduct"><a class="header" href="#conduct">Conduct</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.</li>
<li>Please avoid using overtly sexual aliases or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.</li>
<li>Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.</li>
<li>Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.</li>
<li>Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.</li>
<li>We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the <a href="https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md">Citizen Code of Conduct</a>; if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition.</li>
<li>In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.</li>
<li>Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the chuck-stack moderation team immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.</li>
<li>Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="moderation"><a class="header" href="#moderation">Moderation</a></h2>
<p>These are the policies for upholding our community’s standards of conduct. If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the chuck-stack moderation team.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remarks that violate the chuck-stack standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)</li>
<li>Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.</li>
<li>Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.</li>
<li>If the warning is unheeded, the user will be "kicked," i.e., kicked out of the communication channel to cool off.</li>
<li>If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.</li>
<li>Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.</li>
<li>If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, in private. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.</li>
<li>Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the chuck-stack community, we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don’t just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they’re off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.</p>
<p>And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could’ve communicated better — remember that it’s your responsibility to make your fellow stackers comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.</p>
<p>The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official chuck-stack venues; including communication channels, repositories, and all forums.</p>
