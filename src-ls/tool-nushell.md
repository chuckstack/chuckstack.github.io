# Nushell

[Nushell](https://nushell.sh) is a Linux terminal shell that makes processing and visualizing data easier. For the chuck-stack, Nushell excels beyond others because of its preference for and usability with structured data and [data pipelines](./terminology.md#data-pipeline). 

## Why We Love Nushell

Here are the reasons we love Nushell:

- It is an active and welcoming project, and it is well documented.
- It is open source.
- You can get up and running with Nushell in a meaningful way in minutes.
- It does its job ([data pipelines](./terminology.md#data-pipeline)) amazingly well.
- It makes the data we need to do our jobs immediately available.
- It makes creating modules, scripts and plugins significantly easier (as compared to bash and other shells).
- It visualizes structured data in a terminal better than just about any other tool.
- It has great synergy with the rest of the chuck-stack.

## Notes and References

- Nushell has not reached production stability yet; although, it is close. The Nushell team still introduces frequent breaking changes in an effort to enhance consistency and improve usability.
- Nushell compliments PostgreSQL in that Nushell can perform many of the same data tasks as PostgreSQL without requiring data first be inserted into a database. 
  - Said another way, Nushell gives you many of the same data processing abilities prior to persisting it in a database.
  - Nushell also makes persisting data in PostgreSQL easier.
