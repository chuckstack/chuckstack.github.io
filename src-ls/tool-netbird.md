# Netbird

Organizations need a way to connect people and services separated by distance. [Netbird](https://netbird.io/) is a great tool to create these digital network connections.

## Why We Love Netbird

- It is becoming more popular.
- It is well documented.
- It is open source.
- Its accessibility is secure and well vetted.
- It can be self-hosted
- It makes the services we need to do our jobs immediately available.
- It can be deployed in every corner of the world.
- It can be deployed in hybrid cloud scenarios.
- It can be installed by almost anyone.
- It offers a reasonably simple architecture given the nature of its purpose.
- It scales massively for small to medium organizations.
- It does its job (networking) quite well.
- And, most importantly it has great synergy with the rest of the chuck-stack.

## Keep It Private

The vast majority of data and services consumed by an organization are considered private. You should hide anything you want to keep private from the public internet. Netbird helps you accomplish this goal.

Getting started is simple, and your simple installation can scale quickly and linearly.

## Everyone Needs It

The reason Netbird appears in to top level of chuck-stack tools is because virtually every organization needs a way to connect multiple people and locations. When you deploy the chuck-stack, Netbird (or something like it) needs to be in you plan.

## OpenWRT Router

Note that OpenWRT includes Netbird as a plugin; therefore, you can use OpenWRT to connect multiple sites (cloud and physical locations) to the same overlay network using a relatively simple chuck-stack configuration.
