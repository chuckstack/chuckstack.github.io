## Get Started

Let's discuss how to get started supporting your local community. 

1. Begin by identifying someone in your local community to champion this effort.
1. Determine how you with to start:
  - [Technology co-op](#technology-co-op)
  - [Founding organization(s)](#pick-your-founding-organization)
  - Both

Here is how to get started:

- Purchase a seat in the [stack-academy](./stack-academy.md). You only need one to get started.
- Create a local chuck-stack [benefit entity](#benefit-entity) to amplify your local efforts.
- The stack-academy will help the local benefit entity raise support for more local organizations.
- The local benefit entity will become an expert in supporting the chuck-stack and empower more local organizations.

## Picture of Success

The chuck-stack promotes foundational quality concepts across operations, technology and human resources.

At a minimum, your organizations will learn fundamental best practices. The picture of success means organizations can amplify these best practices using AI to do more, be more and support more of your local community.

What areas of excellence:

- Operational
- Technical
- Human resources

## Foundations in Quality

The minimum your organization will achieve is [quality best practices](./best-practices-operation.md). These are the building blocks to achieve [today's highest standards](./best-practices-operation.md#external-quality-program-breakdown).

We will create a quality standard that adheres to:

- Say what we do
- Do what we said we would do
- Prove that we did it
- Welcome feedback
- Focus on continuous improvement

We will use AI to amplify, augment and automate processes around each of these steps.

## Technology Co-op

One option to get started is to create a local technology co-op. The purpose of the co-op is to provide shared resources for the benefit of local organizations.

Starting the co-op is incredibly simply:

- Purchase a seat in the [stack-academy](./stack-academy.md) - you only need one.
- Find 2 to 3 people from your local community that [fit this description](./blog-chuck-stack-it-job-description-assessment.md).
- Make these people available to your local community in the same way the chuck-stack is organized (open discussion meeting, on-site support, deployment of best practices).

We can help you evaluate and choose your people.

## Pick Your Founding Organization

Another option to get started is by finding small or medium organizations in your country, state, or community that represent the types of organizations you want to see excel.

Here are example criteria to help you pick your local small and medium organizations:

- Desire - find organizations to desire to remain relevant in the next decade
- Spirit - find those who can prove a spirit of willingness and innovation
- Basic capabilities - find those to have access to the minimum technology skill needed (Linux and SQL)

## Funding

The purpose of this section is to discuss local entity funding. Funding can come from many places:

- Federal government
- State government
- Local government
- Foundations

One purpose of the stack-academy is to help your local benefit entity apply for funding to support more local organizations.

## Benefit Entity

A benefit entity is a legal organization owned by someone in your community for the benefit of your community. We purposefully use the word 'benefit' as a general term. The actual types of legal entities vary around the world. For example, you may choose a:

- not-for-profit
- for-profit benefit corporation
- co-op
- social purpose corporations
- low-profit limited liability companies (L3Cs)

There are also local certifications that help you assert your entity meets social and environmental standards.

The point is that you should be aware of what types of local entities best serve your community's needs.
