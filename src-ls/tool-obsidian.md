# Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a writing application that saves content in markdown format. It offers an enjoyable writing experience and a large collection of plugin tools to aid in the thinking, organizing and writing process. 

## Why We Love Obsidian

Here are the reasons we love Obsidian:

- It is commonly used and well documented.
- It has a vibrant online support community.
- While it is not open source, the content you create is maintained in markdown and is all yours.
- You can get up and running with Incus in a meaningful way in minutes.
- It does its job (writing) quite well.
- It integrates with [Git](./tools-git.md) quite well.
- It attracts a large collection of well-maintained plugins.
- It offers a reasonably simple architecture given the nature of its purpose.
- It can be deployed in every corner of the world.
- And, most importantly it has great synergy with the rest of the chuck-stack.

Special considerations for Obsidian:

- Obsidian is not free for commercial use. While you can install it for free, and it is free for personal use, you do need to pay per user per year for commercial use.
- Our opinion is that $50/user/year (as of the time of writing) is high value. The few people in your organization whose primary task is writing will appreciate and benefit from this tool.

## Alternatives

Obsidian is the tool we enjoy the most for what the chuck-stack needs. However, there are alternatives.

- [logseq](https://logseq.com/) - similar to Obsidian, and it is open source; however, it does not produce as pure of markdown as Obsidian since it is more geared towards daily journals and outlines. ([see discussion/comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtZWVoTWv74))
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - or any text editor that understand markdown.
- [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - has great support for markdown documents.
