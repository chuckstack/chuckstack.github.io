# Why Conversational Enterprise Computing Matters

The purpose of this page is to discuss why [Conversational Enterprise Computing](./terminology.md#conversational-enterprise-computing) matters.

Let's start with the benefits:

- The systems follows work instructions,
- as a result, more people can contribute to [OTVE](./terminology.md#otve)
- as a result, less computer code is required to deliver the application
- as a result, infrastructure complexity can be reduced
- as a result, fewer experts are needed to manage the application
- as a result, more resources are available to improve work instructions (reference to the first bullet)
- as a result, you maximize your ability to deliver on your organization's purpose

In the [chuck-stack introduction](./introduction.md#purpose), we stated the following. This document helps explain how this is possible.

> If we succeed executing our purpose, we will give small and medium sized organizations a competitive advantage against both its peers as well as larger organizations.

This style of computing make no references to what tools are used to create the application or how the application is delivered (web versus terminal). 

The chuck-stack positions itself as a leader in conversational enterprise computing by assembling the tools and the best practices in one place and teaching anyone who is willing to learn.
