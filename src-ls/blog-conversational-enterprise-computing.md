# Why Conversational Enterprise Computing Matters

The purpose of this page is to discuss why [Conversational Enterprise Computing](./terminology.md#conversational-enterprise-computing) matters.

Let's start with the cascading benefits:

- The systems follows work instructions,
- as a result, more people can contribute to [OTVE](./terminology.md#otve)
- as a result, less computer code is required to deliver the application
- as a result, infrastructure complexity can be reduced
- as a result, fewer experts are needed to manage the application
- as a result, more resources are available to improve work instructions (reference to the first bullet)
- as a result, you maximize your ability to deliver on your organization's purpose

In the [chuck-stack introduction](./introduction.md#purpose), we stated the following. This document helps explain you can use the cascading benefits of conversational enterprise computing to do more. Said another way, it shows how this statement is possible.

> If we succeed executing our purpose, we will give small and medium sized organizations a competitive advantage against both its peers as well as larger organizations.

Note that conversational enterprise computing makes no references to what tools are used to create the application or how the application is delivered (web versus terminal). It is just a style or a type computing that sits in stark contrast to the last 20 years of ERP.

The chuck-stack positions itself as a leader in conversational enterprise computing by putting in the work to assemble the tools, document the best practices in one place, and teach anyone who is willing to learn. Said another way, we go to heroic efforts to make this style of computing available to everyone in every corner of the world.
