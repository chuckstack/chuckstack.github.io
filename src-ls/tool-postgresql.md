# PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is an open source database, and it is quite possibly the best general purpose tool for managing data in the world. We realize this is a bold statement; however, after almost 30 years in mid-market ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), we know a thing about managing data. PostgreSQL is our preferred tool in its category for some very good reasons.

## Why We Love PostgreSQL

The list of reasons we love PostgreSQL is long and well distinguished.

- It is commonly used and well documented.
- It is open source.
- It is easily accessible from anywhere in the world.
- Its accessibility is secure and well vetted.
- It has a vibrant online support community.
- It makes the data we need to do our jobs immediately available.
- It can be deployed in every corner of the world.
- It can be deployed in hybrid cloud scenarios.
- It is CLI first to help support AI and automation.
- It offers a reasonably simple architecture given the nature of its purpose.
- It scales massively for small to medium organizations.
- It does its job (data) quite well.
- And, most importantly it has great synergy with the rest of the chuck-stack.

Here are some bullets that are unique to PostgreSQL that make it significantly better than its peers for the chuck-stack.

- It can hold almost any type of data: relational, GIS, vector, document, json, and more...
- It is not enough to simply say it can hold this data - it is better than almost all of its peers who often specialize in these types of data.
- Data replication is predictable.
- Data replication is configurable (streaming vs logical).
- Data backup strategies are numerous, robust and well documented.
- There are PostgreSQL drivers, adapters, connectors for almost every major platform (OS and application).
- It is fast!
- It can read from many foreign data containers via FDW (Foreign Data Wrappers) - [see the list](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers).
