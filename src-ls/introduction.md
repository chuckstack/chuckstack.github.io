# Introduction

chuck-stack is both a collection of tools and an application framework that help small to medium organizations manage data and processes.

chuck-stack exists to solve a problem: ERP is too big, slow, expensive and complicated from almost every perspective (learn, configure, develop, audit, deploy, train, service, scale, enhance, etc...). chuck-stack represents a dramatic departure from the sea of window, tabs and fields found in most ERP and data management systems. Instead, chuck-stack provides a simplified, ai-focused interface created from a collection of off-the-shelf tools that help organizations manage data and process workflows from anywhere.

The purpose of the chuck-stack is to help organizations:

- Increase transactional velocity and efficiency
- Identify and deploy AI-enabled, self-service tools that drive innovation from everyone in your organization
- Build an internal and external community of support and innovation

# Why chuck-stack is Important

We believe in a cooperative approach to learning, support and innovation. As a group, we establish the principles and collectively create an open source platform that values simplicity, stability and self-service.
