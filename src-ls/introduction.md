# Introduction

<!-- copied_from_home_page -->
chuck-stack is both a collection of tools and an application framework that help small to medium organizations manage data and processes.

chuck-stack exists to solve a problem: many (if not most) small to medium organizations do not have the knowledge and resources to automate their processes. This is largely because ERP and most development frameworks are too big, slow, expensive and complicated from almost every perspective (learn, configure, develop, audit, deploy, train, service, scale, enhance, etc...).

chuck-stack provides a better way to manage the processes and data in your organization. We deliver a simplified, ai-focused application created from a collection of off-the-shelf tools that help organizations focus on what matters most - its people and value proposition to the world.

The purpose of the chuck-stack is to help organizations:

- Increase transactional velocity and efficiency
- Identify and deploy AI-enabled, self-service tools that drive innovation from everyone in your organization
- Build an internal and external community of support and innovation

## Why chuck-stack is Important

We believe in a cooperative approach to learning, support and innovation. As a group, we establish the principles and collectively create an open source platform that values simplicity, stability and self-service.
