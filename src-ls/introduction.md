# Introduction

<!-- copied_from_home_page -->
chuck-stack is both a collection of tools and an application framework that help small to medium organizations manage data and processes.

chuck-stack exists to solve a problem: many (if not most) small to medium organizations do not have the knowledge and resources to automate their processes. This is largely because ERP and most development frameworks are too big, slow, expensive and complicated from almost every perspective (learn, configure, develop, audit, deploy, train, service, scale, enhance, etc...).

chuck-stack provides a better way to manage the processes and data in your organization. We deliver a simplified, ai-focused application created from a collection of off-the-shelf tools that help organizations focus on what matters most - its people and value proposition to the world.

## Purpose

The purpose of the chuck-stack is to help organizations:

- Increase transactional velocity and efficiency
- Identify and deploy AI-enabled, self-service tools that drive innovation from everyone in your organization
- Build an internal and external community of support and innovation

If we succeed executing our purpose, we will give small and medium sized organizations a competitive advantage against both its peers as well as larger organizations.

## Solution Summary

The chuck-stack consists of two parts:

1. Collection of [tools](stack-tools.md): Linux, PostgreSQL, PostgREST, Nushell, AIChat, Zellij, plus more... that all come together to create a full-featured platform. There is no secret or proprietary sauce. Instead, it is pure open source synergy!
2. Application framework: executing best practices with the above tools and teaching AI to automate the fundamentals of your organization.

## Education

The stack-academy exists to help your organization achieve success as quickly as possible. It's an online support infrastructure that teaches organizations how to install and use the tools, leverage best practices, and foster [superclerk](./terminology.md#superclerk) talent.

- Teach your technical staff to best introduce the tools with your existing infrastructure.

## chuck-stack Customers

Deploying enterprise systems is not easy. Small and mid-sized organizations often need additional help to ensure success. We support both organizations:

- Integrators - organizations with the specialty of enterprise system deployment and support.
- End-users - organizations who will use the chuck-stack in its operations.

Both types of customers are vitally important to ensuring our mutual success. Both customers are welcome and supported in the [stack-academy](./stack-academy.md) and in our community.

## Why chuck-stack is Important

There is not much like the chuck-stack on the market. There is NO private equity or venture capitalist manipulating the market in hopes of extracting customer profits and executing a windfall chuck-stack sale. Instead, the chuck-stack is built on basic principles and fundamentals to make the world a better place for organizations with a purpose for good. The principles are pretty straight forward:

- Find good tools
- Publish best practices and welcome feedback
- Teach anyone who will listen
- Invest in people worthy of your time and effort
- Strive for continuous improvement
- Tell the truth

We believe in a cooperative approach to learning, support and innovation. We work off of principles, and we collectively create an open source platform that values simplicity, stability and self-service.
