# Words are all you need - Neural Software Execution

## Purpose

Respond to https://youtu.be/Z-XYhq0190E

## Problem Statements

Many people frame neural execution in terms of GUI (graphical user interface). This is a mistake for the following reasons:

- GUI is expensive in terms of creation and maintenance
- GUI is expensive in terms of testing
- GUI has limited inter-operability with anything other than present human

## Proposed Framework

Think in terms of words. More specifically, think in terms of commands or the CLI (command line interface). 

- Neural software's strength reside in making judgements (thinking)

## Connection Between Words and Commands



problem with conversations these days about neural software and neural execution, AI. Is it they're framed in a discussion around the user interface. And I feel like that's a mistake. I feel like it should be framed around words, really concepts, but for now let's just use words. Because so much can be done, which is a simple word. I't want to draw a connection in between words and the command line and specifically the commands that exist in the command line. Because command line commands represent a vocabulary or words or concepts, and they are rich and they' deep and their powerful and are capable. And they enapsillate a certain amount of capability. But yeah, there's simple to wield as a word. There's no user interface. There's no UIUX. There's no response. There's no of this stuff. You... Read more
