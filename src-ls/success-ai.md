# Success with AI

Generative AI (specifically [aichat](./tool-aichat.md)) was the catalyst to create the chuck-stack. Almost everything we do related to ERP involves language and the translation between languages.

- work instructions - basic building block for operations (tool, task and role)
- database (SQL) - basic repository for data and event history
- data translation - moving between languages (CSV, JSON, ...)
- execution - orchestration of work instructions to manage data and execute translation/transformation

## Use of AI

AI is what enabled conversational enterprise computing. 

AI does the following for the chuck-stack:

- allows the terminal to emerge from obscurity to present itself as a first class tool for user engagement.
- helps normal users create insights from mass amounts of data.
- helps deploy small agents to assist in real-time decision making and validation based on insights
- helps users automate tasks in their roles with autonomy from IT personnel

## AI as a System

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRTcE19M-KE) does a great job of characterizing our approach to AI systems deployment. Any one model by itself does not help an organization. Instead, the chuck-stack's use of work instructions, database conventions, tool deployment, multi-model prompting, and best paractices drive success with the chuck-stack.
