# Success with AI

The purpose of this page is to describe how the chuck-stack uses AI to help small and medium organization improve operational excellence.

While generative AI (specifically [aichat](./tool-aichat.md)) was the catalyst to create the chuck-stack, AI (in all its forms) is what drives conversational enterprise computing! We now have the ability to put more tools with less effort in the hand of the people who actually perform an organization's work.

## Self-Help

IT departments have historically served to create tools for organizations. No more...

> The chuck-stack is singularly focused on creating a platform of self-help tools.
>
> Said another way, the chuck-stack changes how technical users serve an organization by moving away from tool creation and moving toward self-help augmentation and automation.

## AI in the chuck-stack

The chuck-stack uses AI to help organizations is three high-level ways:

- Data insights - using traditional BI and AI analytics to drive insights and operational objectives (mission, vision, values, principles)
- Real-time assistance - helping users receive the right information, make the right decisions, execute the right actions, and eliminating mistakes
- Role augmentation and automation - helping users automate and monitor their role's tasks without the direct involvement of IT (classical tool generation)

We believe that generative AI makes technology more accessible to more people. Said another way, we believe we can put more technical reasoning tools in the hands of the 'everyday' worker and help them better execute their roles.

## AI Data Insights

Traditional/classical AI analytics methodologies continue to drive an organization's success. The datasets are getting bigger, and the analysis tools are getting better. Here is an example where a traditional IT resource will create a self-help platform.

Here are the high-level steps:

- Extract, transform and load the data into an appropriate columnar storage and processing tool (Spark, Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery)
- Work with a qualified data analytics professional to analyze the data using best practices
- Establish the behaviors that create the most beneficial outcomes
- Build tools that offer real-time assistance and augmentation (next section) to drive future behaviors

## AI Real-Time Assistance and Augmentation

A chuck-stack success factor is getting AI to help organizations think and reason about operations. Here is how we use our AI Brain to think:

- Working memory (cli and shell session engagement and current context)
- Episodic/augmented Memory (attribute tagging important observations and references)
- Semantic memory (work instruction retrieval)
- Procedural memory (scripts and workflow)

## AI Principles

Here are the AI principles that drive our decisions:

- Simplify the AI tool sets to the extent possible
- Bring the model and code to the data
- Make the models and code useful to those who actually perform the work

## AI as a System

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRTcE19M-KE) does a great job of characterizing our approach to AI systems deployment. Any one model by itself does not help an organization. Instead, the chuck-stack's use of work instructions, database conventions, tool deployment, multi-model prompting, and best practices drive success with the chuck-stack.
