## Don't Just Survive - Thrive Beyond 2025

The purpose of this post is to provide a blueprint for operational efficiency and excellence in 2025 and beyond. 

Here is the benefit story:

- demonstrate how to quickly and easily leverage AI LLMs (large language models) to increase operational accuracy and precision
- bring work instructions and documentation to life using free and off-the-shelf tools with minimal effort
- help your people augment and automate processes using work instructions
- give you a practical example of a company growing from 6 locations to 60 locations

> It is important to note that I am a champion of small to medium organizations. You are my target audience. This post was written for you! 

As a result of this article, you can:

- Publish your work instructions and documentation to the web or local intranet
- Give users a chat interface to understand their documentation
- Provide workflow to easily update documentation
- Ensure your chat (AI/LLM) always knows the current instructions

## Problem Statements

**Problem #1:** People are generally not good at following directions with near perfect precision. We are creative, imaginative, and (as a result of these strengths) we are often distracted. These distractions sometimes result in mistakes when performing tasks.

**Problem #2:** People have a limited ability to hold information in their conscience context when performing a task. Sometimes we need to look things up for reference.

**Problem #3:** It is often easier to ask for help than to find the answer yourself. Much of an organization's efficiency is lost because institutional knowledge is either not written down, it is located in an inconvenient location, or your organization has trained people to ask instead of self-help.

**Problem #4:** Finding information is not always easy even when you know where to look. Understanding the information after you find it can be even more difficult.

**Problem #5:** The current solutions for solving these problems can be very expensive. AI is an expensive marketing buzz word.

## Quality Big Picture

Before we outline the solution, it is pivotal we see the big picture. Basic quality concepts are more important today than ever before. We cannot state this strongly enough!

Here are the foundations of any quality standard. If you do not currently have a quality manual, put these five bullets on a document and publish it everywhere. If you did nothing else, this would be an amazing start!

- Say what you do
- Do what you say
- Prove you did it
- Ask for feedback
- Continually improve

  <source src="./video/02-gen-wi-demo-say-what-you-do.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

We use organizational basics (like work instructions) to drive continuous improvement by deploying these instructions into our live systems. We expect everyone in the organization to improve them. With every improvement, the system evolves.

Point of reflection: if you are not willing to create the above one-page quality manual to drive your organization forward, do not bother reading further.

## Create Training from Work Instructions

There is no better way than to simply show you what is possible when you write it down!

Here is an example where we create a job aid/visual from an existing work instruction document:

  <source src="./video/03-gen-wi-demo-claude-demo-job-aid.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Here is an example where we create a training quiz from an existing work instruction document:

<video poster="./img/04-gen-wi-demo-claude-demo-quiz.png" controls>
  <source src="./video/04-gen-wi-demo-claude-demo-quiz.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

By using the US Constitution, we highlight the profound effect you can create by simply writing the instructions. 

## Work Instruction Vision and Goal

It will take a moment for people to get used to simply 'asking' your system for help. However, when they do, they will be surprised with the answers they get. 

Were you aware that an LLM could create a visual job aid or an interactive quiz based on a work instruction? Just wait, it is about to get even more exciting.

## Obsidian Plain Markdown Text

LLMs are large language models. They have an incredible ability to understand text. When you write your work instructions in 'text' (not Word or Google Docs) just plain text, you gain the ability to use any and every LLM in the world, and therefore, you gain the ability to use just about every tool.

## Feedback Loop

Notes about organizational evolution through continual feedback:

- Quality standards ask you for follow your own directions.
- These standards ask that you prove you followed the standards released at the moment the action was performed.
- Most standards do not dictate the velocity at which you evolve.
- They simply request you ask for feedback and act accordingly.
- They often do ask you to reflect on the impact of your changes.

</video>

In the above video, we use github.com to manage all changes. GitHub provides Git services. You might not be familiar with Git; therefore, it is worth discussing a few points to consider in a later conversation:

- Git tracks every change by every member, and as a result, you can report on these changes.
- Git allows for making changes in an off-to-the-side branch where you can stage, test and review changes before they are released.
- Git gives your organization the power to articulate exactly how you want to manage change.

## Tools and More

Said simply: LLMs help help you process more information, make better decisions, and execute more tasks with greater velocity.

Said with more detail:

- An LLM is a neural network with the ability to predict what should 'be' next based on a given context.
- It can help you solve many if not all the above problem statements.
- Your success with LLMs depends on how you empower your roles to use LLMs to augment and automate many of the routine operations of your organization.

This video shows you an example of how you describe (in plain text) the steps of an operation, and it also shows how you can tell the LLM which to accomplish the task.

## Next Steps

If you want help implementing these concepts in your organization, join the [stack-academy](./stack-academy.md). We will walk you though the process of:

- deploying your first Obsidian + Git + website + chat solution in your organization
- identifying and create your first set of work instructions for a target role
- teaching your content writers how to write the fewest words possible to achieve the desired result
- soliciting feedback from everyone after the initial deployment

## Tools Summary

Here are the tools we use to minimize effort and maximize agency:

- We use [Obsidian](./tool-obsidian.md) to help your primary leaders 'say' what to do.
- We use [AIChat](./tool-aichat.md) to 
  - deliver a kind and patent 'chat' experience
  - evaluate user interactions with 'chat'
  - propose improvements to work instructions
- We use [mdBook](./tool-mdbook.md) to publish our instructions
- We use [ttyd](./tool-ttyd.md) to expose AIChat and other tools
- We use [Netbird](./tool-netbird.md) to ensure our work instructions and our tools are both private to our organization AND available to everyone in our organization

## Example Company

- typical owner operator - injected with reason to grow



## Free Picture of Success (consider)

This posts walks you through the steps to deploy a solution that solves the above problems using free tools.

Before we get into the details of the solution, I want to state a few important summary points about writing documentation and work instructions. You can find [more details here](./best-practices-operation.md#quality-program-principles).

- Current foundation LLMs (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, ...) know more about public topics that any one human. I have spent 20 years in ERP, and they know far more about this topic than I do. If a topic has been reasoned about on the internet, these LLMs know about it.
- The goals of writing documentation have changed. You no longer need to write down everything. Instead, you need to write just enough where the LLM knows what you are discussion and how you want it discussed. The LLM can fill in ancillary details.
- [more...](./best-practices-operation.md#quality-program-principles)

Here is what I am proposing:

- Use [Obsidian](./tool-obsidian.md) to help your core documentation resources create your instructions as [markdown text](./blog-live-markdown-world.md).
- Configure Obsidian to save your team's work in a [git repository](./tool-git.md). This will give your whole organization special powers to make continual changes in a controlled way.
- Use [mdBook](./tool-mdbook.md) to publish your work instructions to your intended audience. See [Netbird](./tool-netbird.md) if you need to create a private network.
- Use [AIChat](./tool-aichat.md) to a) ingest your work instructions so that an LLM/AI can answer question and b) make the LLM/AI/Chat available directly inside your mdBook website.

## Implementation Details (consider)

Here are the steps to accomplish my proposed documentation and work instruction love story:

- Install Obsidian on the machines documentation and work instruction power users. Follow [operation best practices](./best-practices-operation.md) and [Obsidian](./tool-obsidian.md) best practices.
- Configure the following in Obsidian:
  - Install the `git` community plugin. This allows you to easily sync all changes to a single place.
  - Change the default Obsidian link method to use the markdown style: `[link name](./link-to-file)` instead of the default wikilinks style: `[[file-name]]`. This change is needed when you publish using mdBook.
- Create a new server with [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) and [AIChat](./tool-aichat.md) installed on your network to publish your documentation. See configuration below.
- Create a scheduled script on your server to do the following (see details below):
  - Download and publish the latest documentation changes
  - Update your LLM with the latest changes to ensure it can answer questions correctly

Now, let's get into more detail.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do we need an LMS?

Maybe. Before you think about learning (LMS) or training systems, create your work instructions. Managers need to document roles. Users document tasks. Everyone documents tools.

Only after you have reached the point where your work instructions have reached 'live' status, should you consider an LMS. Then, think critically about whether the learning/training system will slow you down or better your operations.
