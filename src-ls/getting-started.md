# Getting Started

By now, you should understand [why the project exists](./introduction.md) and [where we are headed](./picture-success.md).

> Note: chuck-stack is in pre-alpha. We do not have an installation script yet. [Sign up](../learn-more.html) to be notified when it comes.

In the mean time, here are our recommendations to get started:
- Read the [best practices](./best-practices.md). If you want help creating and deploy work instructions, [join the stack-academy](https://buy.stripe.com/7sIbLIeeU3oT4IEfYY). This is a very important step to realizing the vision! This is something you can start right now!
- Install [aichat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat). This application plays a very big part of the chuck-stack. You want to be able to launch a console and use AIChat with a single key stroke. This one act will improve your productivity immensely.

This page will evolve over time as the chuck-stack progresses. We look forward to working with you!
