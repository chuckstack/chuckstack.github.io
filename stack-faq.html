      <h2>chuck-stack FAQ</h2>
      <p> The purpose of this page is to answer frequently asked questions (FAQ) about the chuck-stack. </p>

      <!-- h3-name -->
      <h3 id="name">Is chuck-stack really the name of the project?</h3>
      <p> Yes and no... Naming a project is hard. chuck-stack is a good starting name given that Chuck Boecking has spent the last 25 years immersed in small-to-medium business ERP, data management, and IT. This project started as result of what we believe to be safe, usable, reliable and performant. If the community believes there is a better name to represent this project, then we will change the name accordingly. That will be a good day! </p>
    <!-- ./ h3-name -->

      <!-- h3-how-choose -->
      <h3 id="how-choose">How do we choose stack components?</h3>
      <p> The chuck-stack has been cultivated over the last 25 years. Here are the guidelines for inclusion: </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Commonly used - and well understood to make AI augmentation easier.</li>
          <li>Open source - or at least as open as possible.</li>
          <li>Start simple - easy to understand and reason about. Nix pushes this concept a little (or a lot); however, the power and simplicity it creates is worth the extra effort.</li>
          <li>Basic functionality - supports basics like CRUD (create, read, update and delete) with minimal effort.</li>
          <li>Kind educator - needs someone in the community who makes the technology kind to the target audience.</li>
          <li>Kind integrator - needs someone local to you digitally to help you leverage the tool.</li>
          <li>Synergy - supports other tools in the stack. Example: runs on or integrates with PostgreSQL.</li>
          <li>Simple architecture - not overly complicated relative to the tool's purpose.</li>
          <li>Enterprise scalability - it needs to scale to support an organization of at least 1,000+ across multiple continents.</li>
          <li>Enterprise testing and deployment - it needs to support team development where improvements can be development, tested and accepted in dedicated environments and easily migrated to production using CI/CD concepts or scripts.</li>
          <li>Command Line Interface (CLI) centric - we love cli interfaces because they are accessible from anywhere.</li>
          <li>REST centric - we love scriptable interfaces that can be called from anywhere (not just the cli).</li>
      </ul>
