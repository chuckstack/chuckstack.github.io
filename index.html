        <!-- copied_from_introduction_page -->
        <p> <b>What makes us special?</b> <u><i>conversational enterprise computing</i></u> on an open source technology stack... We are tired of ERP's hitting organizations with thousands of barely relevant fields that overly complicate processes. We offer a better way to support enterprise data and build <a href="./ls/terminology.html#superclerk">superclerk</a> talent.</p>
        <p> chuck-stack is both a collection of tools and an application framework that help small to medium organizations manage data and processes. </p>
        <p> <b>chuck-stack exists to solve a problem:</b> many (if not most) small to medium organizations do not have the knowledge and resources to automate their processes. This is largely because ERP and most development frameworks are too big, slow, expensive and complicated from almost every perspective (learn, configure, develop, audit, deploy, train, service, scale, enhance, etc...). </p>
        <p> We deliver a simplified, ai-focused application created from a collection of off-the-shelf tools that help organizations focus on what matters most - its people and value proposition to the world. </p>

        <!-- copied_from_picture_success_page -->
        <p> Imagine a world where your operations team wrote work instructions and both your system and people magically executed those work instructions for you with near perfection. Image a world where IT no longer builds tools but instead helps your people build logic themselves while ensuring everyone is bound by their documented roles. You do not need to imagine much longer.</p>

        <h2>chuck-stack Tools</h2>
        <p> When choosing our stack tools, we: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Focus on commonly used and well understood tools to make AI augmentation easier. The better AI understands a tool, the more AI can do the work for you.</li>
            <li>Choose tools that build on one another: PostgreSQL => PostgREST => Nushell => AIChat => Zellij... </li>
            <li>Select tools that allow unlimited usage and scale massively.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> For an extended list of tools, see: <a href="./ls/stack-tools.html#most-important-tools">Stack Tools</a>. Here is <a href="./ls/stack-tools.html#selection-criteria-summary">how we choose</a> what goes into the stack.</p>

      <section id="application">
        <h2>chuck-stack Application Framework</h2>
        <p> chuck-stack uses the above tools to create an application framework for data and process management. Here are the framework goals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Minimize application framework code and complexity by using off-the-shelf tools that are easily understood by people and AI.. </li>
          <li>Minimize the effort to create new business logic. Ideally, a single command will create the template for you. AI will draft the code for you.</li>
          <li>Maximize who in an organization can automate business logic by supporting role-based contracts where role boundaries are well defined and AI can help ensure proper <a href="./ls/stack-faq.html#what-is-capability-sandboxing">capability sandboxing</a> and data integrity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data management goes beyond simple CRUD (create, read, update and delete) database operations. The system needs to make the right data available to the right person at the right time to make their jobs easier. There are two key features that make this vision a reality: 1) workflow and 2) attribute tagging. Here are the details:</p>
        <h4>Workflow</h4>
        <p>Workflow is critical to data and process management. However, workflow is notoriously difficult. The concepts can be difficult to learn. The applications are often difficult to install and maintain, and they are either too complicated or overly simple. It is incredibly difficult to create a workflow architecture that is both generic enough and easy enough for broad adoption. AI will change the workflow landscape. What was previously tedious, is becoming a conversation.</p>
