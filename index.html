        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> chuck-stack is both a collection of tools and an application framework that help small to medium organizations manage data and processes. </p>
        <p> chuck-stack exists to solve a problem: ERP is too big, slow, expensive and complicated from almost every perspective (learn, configure, develop, audit, deploy, train, service, scale, enhance, etc...). chuck-stack provides a simplified, ai-focused interface created from a collection of off-the-shelf tools that help organizations manage data and process workflows from anywhere. </p>

        <h2>chuck-stack Tools</h2>
        <p> When choosing our stack tools, we: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Focus on commonly used and well understood tools to make AI augmentation easier.</li>
            <li>Choose tools that build on one another: PostgreSQL => PostgREST => Nushell => AIChat => Zellij... </li>
            <li>Minimize the knowledge and skill required to become productive.</li>
            <li>Select tools where usage is unlimited.</li>
            <li>Focus on putting easy and logical tools in the hands of every day users so that a clerk can more easily become a superclerk.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Below are the most important stack tools. For an extended list of tools, see: <a href="stack-faq.html#stack-tools">Stack Tools</a>. Here is <a href="stack-faq.html#how-choose">how we choose</a> what goes into the stack.</p>
        <h4>Linux and PostgreSQL</h4>
        <p> <a href="https://www.linux.org/">Linux</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> are at the heart of the stack. Both are phenomenally well understand and established open source projects that form much of our world's digital backbone. Here is why they are important to the stack:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scale massively</li>
            <li>Provide great documented and community support</li>
            <li>Offer a rich ecosystem of plugins and enhancements</li>
            <li>Manage users, roles, authentication and authorization as well as any platform</li>
            <li>Deploy almost anywhere</li>
            <li>Maintain just about any type of data</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>PostgREST</h4>
        <p> <a href="https://postgrest.org/">PostgREST</a> is a secret weapon that allows us to build a fully-qualified and secure REST API directly on top of a PostgreSQL database schema and users/roles. If you can build a good database with functions, you can build a good REST API. </p>
        <h4>Github.com</h4>
        <p> <a href="https://github.com/">Github.com</a> is the most valuable platform for managing work instructions and organizational knowledge. Here is why it is so important to the stack: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The world's smartest people performing some of the most difficult work across the greatest distances use github to manage their instuctions. If it works for them, it should easily support your team!</li>
            <li>It offers both issue tracking and discussions.</li>
            <li>It provides both project management and kanban board organization.</li>
            <li>It supports automation based on changes to content or instructions.</li>
            <li>It is priced significantly less than other enterprise productivity tools.</li>
            <li>It makes more AI tools available to your team to understand and improve your processes.</li>
            <li>Once your team understands how to collectively contribute to the instructions that runs your organization, operations will never look the same again!</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>AIChat</h4>
        <p> <a href="https://github.com/sigoden/aichat">AIChat</a> is a command line AI tool that helps you create and simplify organizational operations. Here is how it can help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With one command, it can take your entire organization's work instructions and make it so that anyone can ask questions and improve your processes.</li>
            <li>Create training material and quizzes about your operations to ensure compliance.</li>
            <li>Help your IT department create more self-service tools with PostgreSQL and PostgREST.</li>
            <li>Automate complex operations using simple human language.</li>
            <li>Digest images, extract structured data from images, create images based on work instructions.</li>
            <li>Connect to almost any AI LLM model (like chatGPT, Claude and Gemini).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Nushell</h4>
        <p> <a href="https://www.nushell.sh">Nushell</a> is both a scripting language and a command line shell to transform data and automate processes. Here is how it can help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create full-featured cli applications with just a few lines of code.</li>
            <li>Call on external API (including PostgREST) to integration expternal system and data.</li>
            <li>Call your cli applications from AIchat with minimal configuration.</li>
            <li>Compose more complex workflows using data pipelines.</li>
            <li>Expose your cli applications to power users to support self-help automation with the assistance of AIChat.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Zellij</h4>
        <p> <a href="https://zellij.dev/">Zellij</a> is a terminal workspace manager. Here is how it can help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Easily manage multiple windows and tabs in a single ssh session.</li>

        <h2>chuck-stack Application Framework</h2>
        <p> chuck-stack uses the above tools to create an application framework for data and process management. Here are the framework goals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Minimize application framework code. Instead, use chuck-stack off-the-shelf tools to provide data capture and visualization.</li>
          <li>Minimize the effort to create new business logic. Ideally, a single command will create the template for you. AI will draft the code for you.</li>
          <li>Maximize who in an organization can automate business logic by supporting role-based contracts where role boundaries are well defined and AI can help ensure proper <a href="stack-faq.html#capability-sandbox">capability sandboxing</a> and data integrity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data management goes beyond simple CRUD (create, read, update and delete) database operations. The system needs to make the right data available to the right person at the right time to make their jobs easier. There are two key process features that make this vision a reality: 1) workflow and 2) attribute tagging. Here are the details:</p>
        <h4>Workflow</h4>
        <p>Workflow is critical to data and process management. However, workflow is notoriously difficult. The concepts can be difficult to learn. The applications are often difficult to install and maintain, and they are either too complicated or overly simple. It is incredibly difficult to create a workflow architecture that is both generic enough and easy enough for broad adoption. AI will change the workflow landscape. What was previously tedious, is becoming a conversation.</p>
        <p>TODO: consider calling this User Facing Workflows to differentiate from developer workflows like events and functions. Or, consider labeling the below bullets with user/developer/system.</p>
        <p>Here are the important types of workflow.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Journal workflow: everyone in an organization should be able to record the events in an organization. More...</li>
          <li>Discussion workflow: everyone in an organization should be able to collaborate with others in an organization. More...</li>
          <li>To-do workflow: everyone in an organization should be able to manage a simple list of tasks. More...</li>
          <li>Checklist workflow: roles in an organization often have periodic prescribed tasks. Checklists are a predefined and templated to-do tasks. More...  </li>
          <li>Queue workflow: as people manipulate data, some records will reach a state of importance. Queues are defined views into data that match a specific pattern automatically. When the pattern is found, present the user or role with the matching records.  More...</li>
          <li>Notice workflow: events happen, and sometimes users and systems need to be notified. The notification workflow provides information based on the events that occur in an organization.  More...</li>
          <li>Ad-hoc request workflow: users and systems often know what needs to happen and who needs to perform the action based on the events that occur in an organization. This is often referred to as institutional knowledge of action. Ad-hoc request workflows allow users or services to request action from a particular user, role or service.  More...</li>
          <li>Complex request workflow: There are times when an organization needs a formal, multi-step, orchestrated process where a request follows a pre-defined path. Consider calling this 'Orchestrated Request' workflow.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Attribute Tagging</h4>
