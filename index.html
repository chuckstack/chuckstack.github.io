        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> chuck-stack exists to solve a problem: ERP is too slow, expensive and complicated from almost every perspective (learn, configure, develop, audit, deploy, train, service, scale, enhance, etc...). </p>
        <p> chuck-stack represents a dramatic departure from the sea of window, tabs and fields found in most ERP and data management systems. Instead, chuck-stack is a simplified, ai-focused interface that helps organizations manage data and process workflows from anywhere. </p>
        <p> The chuck-stack is a collection of off-the-shelf open-source IT/operations tools and support to boost small to medium-size organization performance. The purpose of the chuck-stack is to help organizations: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase transactional velocity and efficiency</li>
          <li>Identify and deploy AI-enabled, self-service tools that drive innovation from everyone in your organization</li>
          <li>Build an internal and external community of support and innovation</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Why chuck-stack is Important</h4>
        <p> We believe in a cooperative approach to learning, support and innovation. As a group, we establish the principles and collectively create an open source platform that values simplicity, stability and self-service.  </p>
