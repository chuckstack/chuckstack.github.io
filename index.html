        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> chuck-stack exists to solve a problem: ERP is too slow, expensive and complicated from almost every perspective (learn, configure, develop, audit, deploy, train, service, scale, enhance, etc...). </p>
        <p> chuck-stack represents a dramatic departure from the sea of window, tabs and fields found in most ERP and data management systems. Instead, chuck-stack provides a simplified, ai-focused interface created from a collection of off-the-shelf tools that help organizations manage data and process workflows from anywhere. </p>
        <p> The chuck-stack boosts small to medium-size organization performance. The purpose of the chuck-stack is to help organizations: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase transactional velocity and efficiency</li>
          <li>Identify and deploy AI-enabled, self-service tools that drive innovation from everyone in your organization</li>
          <li>Build an internal and external community of support and innovation</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Why chuck-stack is Important</h4>
        <p> We believe in a cooperative approach to learning, support and innovation. As a group, we establish the principles and collectively create an open source platform that values simplicity, stability and self-service.  </p>

        <h2>Important chuck-stack Tools</h2>
        <p> For a list of all stack tools, see: <a href="stack-faq.html#stack-tools">Stack Tools</a> </p>
        <h4>Linux and PostgreSQL</h4>
        <p> <a href="https://www.linux.org/">Linux</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> are at the heart of the stack. Both are phenomenally well understand and established open source projects that form much of our world's digital backbone. Here is why they are important to the stack:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scale massively</li>
            <li>Provide great documented and community support</li>
            <li>Offer a rich ecosystem of plugins and enhancements</li>
            <li>Manage users, roles, authentication and authorization as well as any platform</li>
            <li>Deploy almost anywhere</li>
            <li>See the full list of criteria: <a href="stack-faq.html#how-choose">how we choose</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>PostgREST</h4>
        <p> <a href="https://postgrest.org/">PostgREST</a> is a secret weapon that allows us to build a fully-qualified and secure REST API directly on top of a PostgreSQL database schema and users/roles. If you can build a good database with functions, you can build a good REST API. </p>
        <h4>Github.com</h4>
        <p> <a href="https://github.com/">Github.com</a> is the most valuable platform for managing work instructions and organizational knowledge. Here is why it is so important to the stack: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The world's smartest people performing some of the most difficult work across the greatest distances use github to manage their instuctions. If it works for them, it should easily support your team!</li>
            <li>It offers both issue tracking and discussions.</li>
            <li>It provides both project management and kanban board organization.</li>
            <li>It supports automation based on changes to content or instructions.</li>
            <li>It is priced significantly less than other enterprise productivity tools.</li>
            <li>It makes more AI tools available to your team to understand and improve your processes.</li>
            <li>Once your team understands how to collectively contribute to the instructions that runs your organization, operations will never look the same again!</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>AIChat</h4>
        <p> <a href="https://github.com/sigoden/aichat">AIChat</a> is a command line AI tool that helps you create and simplify organizational operations. Here is how it can help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With one command, it can take your entire organization's work instructions and make it so that anyone can ask questions and improve your processes.</li>
            <li>Create training material and quizzes about your operations to ensure compliance.</li>
            <li>Help your IT department create more self-service tools with PostgreSQL and PostgREST.</li>
            <li>Automate complex operations using simple human language.</li>
            <li>Digest images, extract structured data from images, create images based on work instructions.</li>
            <li>Connect to almost any AI LLM model (like chatGPT, Claude and Gemini).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Pass/gpg</h4>
        <p> <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">Pass</a> is a command line AI tool that helps you manage passwords with gpg. It is simple, scriptable, auditable, distributed and secure. <a href="https://gnupg.org/">gpg</a> is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. The Pass repository is available on almost all platforms. It integrates with github. </p>
